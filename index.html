      I kind of love coding but I never really had time to learn it. I think
      this year will be different as I have had to eventually pay a fortune to
      take this w3 bootcamp. I hope this is going to be the turning point. It is
      taking a lot of my time but I am sure it will be worth it. Now let me get
      back to the work. Code, code and more code.
